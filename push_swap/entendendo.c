	//Set both pointers to NULL to avoid undefined behaviour and indicate we're starting with empty stacks

//Handle input count errors. Argument count must be 2 or more, and the second input must not be empty
	//If input errors, return error

//Handle both cases of input, whether a variable number of command line arguments, or as a string
	//If the input of numbers is as a string, call split() to split the substrings

//Initialize stack `a` by appending each input number as a node to stack `a`
	//Handle integer overflow, duplicates, and syntax errors, e.g. input must only contain digits, or `-` `+` signs
		//If errors found, free stack `a` and return error
	//Check for each input, if it is a long integer
		//If the input is a string, convert it to a long integer 
	//Append the nodes to stack `a`

//Check if stack `a` is sorted
	//If not sorted, implement our sorting algorithm 
		//Check for 2 numbers
			//If so, simply swap the numbers
		//Check for 3 numbers
			//If so, implement our simple `sort three` algorithim
		//Check if the stack has more than 3 numbers
			//If so, implent our Turk Algorithm

//Clean up the stack
